.Synopsis
   This script is meant to be used as part of provisioning package to automate importing autopilot hashes. It can be run from within the full OS or from the OOBE experience. Also send a notification to a Teams Channel
   This script checks if Windows Autopilot Device exists and import / update it based on Default or Bsiness code
.DESCRIPTION
   Import-AutopilotHashFromPpkg is part of a solution to autopmatically upload autopilot hashes directly to Microsoft Intune without direct interaction.

    Full documentation can be found on my blog at https://www.modernendpoint.com/managed

    It was created to be used as part of a provisioning package to allow hashes to be uploaded from the Out of Box experience with little to no interaction. After running the computer
    will return to the out of box experience and the user can continue to log in or a technician can take it through pre-provisioning. Please note that this script will exit once the first stage
    of the import has been completed. I recommend checking the Autopilot devices list to know when they upload has been completed.

    This script will install and import the MSAL.ps module. It was built for authentication with a client secret, but could be adjusted to allow for certificate based authentication. Since the
    client secret is hardcoded in the script, I recommend password protecting the PPKG file. The app registration used should also have limited permissions to limit it to being used for the
    specific purpose.

    Usage: Onboarding Windows devices to autopilot - Intune - Group Tag = EMPTY
